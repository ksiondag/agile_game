Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AgileGame is currently a "paper" prototype for a roguelike spiral-development
game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You start with a repository

That repository has at least one submodule
    agile_game

The rules of AgileGame can be referenced via the agile_game submodule
    The rules are a work in progress
    The rules currently run on the honor system
    The rules can be modified to fit the needs of the player
    The rules can be modified during a session of the game
        All modifications should be towards better development efficiency
            Modifications should not be made to make a session winnable

You have one session to make your prototype
    A session time-limit is defined at the beginning of a session
        Recommend less than an hour
    All code within the game repository is throwaway code
        You can neither copy it nor use it for reference in a future session

Code and documentation can be saved in other submodules 
    This content can be used as reference in future sessions
        (This is what gives this game a roguelike quality)

A session starts when coding for the prototype begins

If you are playing AgileGame, please fork the master repository
    No real reason, I just want to see if others play this game

Only five minutes total can be used to refer to outside documentation
    If outside documentation is refered to
        Look-up must be logged in agile_game/cheatsheet/ directory
    Submodules are not outside documentation

Anything that player wants to do but can't must be logged in agile_game
