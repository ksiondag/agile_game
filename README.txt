Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AgileGame is currently a "paper" prototype for a roguelike agile-development
game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You start with a repository

That repository has at least one submodule
    agile_game

The rules of AgileGame can be referenced via the agile_game submodule
    The rules are a work in progress
    The rules currently run on the honor system
    The rules can be modified to fit the needs of the player
    The rules can be modified during a session of the game
        All modifications should be towards better development efficiency
            Modifications should not be made to make a session winnable

You have one session to make your prototype
    A session time-limit is defined at the beginning of a session
        Recommend less than an hour
    All code within the game repository is throwaway code
        You can neither copy it nor use it for reference in a future session

Code and documentation can be saved in other submodules 
    This content can be used as reference in future sessions
        This is what gives this game a roguelike quality
            It also allows real development in a short time

A session starts when the countdown timer begins

If you are playing AgileGame, please fork the master repository
    No real reason, I just want to see if others play this game

Outside documentation can not be referred to during session
Only five minutes total can be used to refer to outside documentation
    If outside documentation must be refered to for any progress
        End session
            Delete all progress not in submodules
        Look-up necessary information
        Log information
        Restart session
    Submodules are not outside documentation

Anything that player wants to do but can't must be logged in agile_game
    For after-session research purposes
