Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AgileGame is currently a "paper" prototype for a roguelike game-making game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You start with a repository

That repository has two submodules
    game_engine
    agile_game

The rules of AgileGame can be referenced via the agile_game submodule
    The rules are a work in progress
    The rules currently run on the honor system
    The rules can be modified to fit the needs of the player
    The rules can be modified during a session of the game
        All modifications should be towards better game-making efficiency
            Modifications should not be made to make a session winnable

You have one session to make your game
    A session takes one hour
    All code within the game repository is throwaway code
        You can neither copy it or use it for reference in future session

Code and documentation can be saved in game_engine 
    This content can be used as reference in future sessions
        (This is what gives this game a roguelike quality)

game_engine can only be iterated upon while playing a session

A session starts when coding for the game begins

If you are playing AgileGame, please fork the master repository
    No real reason, I just want to see if others play this game
